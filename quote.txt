Everything will come to you at the perfect time
Everything happens for a reason.
success that makes you arrogant is failure.‎..
At the end, everything is fine and if it is not fine then it's not end.
Varun, remember sweet old days?
Do an act of kindness. Help one person smile
Peace begins with a smile
The most beautiful thing you can wear is confidence.
Action is the foundational key to all success
Amateurs sit and wait for inspiration, the rest of us just get up and go to work
Don’t wait. The time will never be just right
The only joy in the world is to begin
Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.
Mirrors can’t talk, lucky for you they can’t laugh either.
You go girl! And don’t come back.
I am busy right now, can I ignore you some other time?
